## What is it?

Django Keycloak Auth is a simple library that authorizes your application's resources using Django Rest Framework.

This package is used to perform authorization by keycloak roles from JWT token. Both realm roles and client roles are
supported.

For example, the following token indicates that the user has the realm role "manager" and the client
roles "director" and "employer" :

```
...

  "realm_access": {
    "roles": [
      "manager"
    ]
  },
  "resource_access": {
    "first-api": {
      "roles": [
        "director",
        "employer",
      ]
    }
  },
  ...
```

## Usage

1. In your application `settings.py` file, add following Middleware:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    #...
    'django_keycloak_auth.middleware.KeycloakMiddleware',
    #...
]

#...

# Exempt URIS
# For example: ['core/banks', 'swagger']
KEYCLOAK_EXEMPT_URIS = []
KEYCLOAK_CONFIG = {
    'KEYCLOAK_SERVER_URL': 'http://localhost:8080/auth',
    'KEYCLOAK_REALM': 'TEST',
    'KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID': 'client-backend',
    'KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET_KEY': 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'
}

```

## How to apply on your Views

### Class-based Views

#### ModelViewSet

```python

from rest_framework import viewsets, views
from . import models, serializers
from rest_framework import status
from django.http.response import JsonResponse
from rest_framework.exceptions import PermissionDenied

class BankViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """
    Bank endpoint
    This endpoint has all configured keycloak roles
    """
    serializer_class = serializers.BankSerializer
    queryset = models.Bank.objects.all()
    keycloak_roles = {
        'GET': ['director', 'judge', 'employee'],
        'POST': ['director', 'judge', ],
        'UPDATE': ['director', 'judge', ],
        'DELETE': ['director', 'judge', ],
        'PATCH': ['director', 'judge', 'employee'],
    }

    def list(self, request):
        """
        Overwrite method
        You can especify your rules inside each method
        using the variable 'request.roles' that means a
        list of roles that came from authenticated token.
        See the following example bellow:
        """
        # list of token roles
        print(request.roles)

        # Optional: get userinfo (SUB attribute from JWT)
        print(request.userinfo)

        return super().list(self, request)
```

#### ViewSet

```python

class CarViewSet(viewsets.ViewSet):
    """
    Car endpoint
    This endpoint has not configured keycloak roles.
    That means all methods will be allowed to access.
    """
    def list(self, request):
        return JsonResponse({"detail": "success"}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

```

#### APIView

```python

class JudgementView(views.APIView):
    """
    Judgement endpoint
    This endpoint has configured keycloak roles only GET method.
    Other HTTP methods will be allowed.
    """
    keycloak_roles = {
        'GET': ['judge'],
    }

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        """
        Overwrite method
        You can especify your rules inside each method
        using the variable 'request.roles' that means a
        list of roles that came from authenticated token.
        See the following example bellow:
        """
        # list of token roles
        print(request.roles)

        # Optional: get userinfo (SUB attribute from JWT)
        print(request.userinfo)

        return super().get(self, request)

```

When you don't put **keycloak_roles** attribute in the Views that means all methods authorizations will be allowed.

### Function Based Views

When if you use `api_view` decorator, you would write a very simple `@keycloak_roles` decorator like this:

```python
from django_keycloak_auth.decorators import keycloak_roles
...

@keycloak_roles(['director', 'judge', 'employee'])
@api_view(['GET'])
def loans(request):
    """
    List loan endpoint
    This endpoint has configured keycloak roles only 
    especific GET method will be accepted in api_view.
    """
    return JsonResponse({"message": request.roles})
```

## Local development

### Run tests for this lib

Before everything, you must install VirtualEnv.

```bash
# Install venv in root project folder
$ python3 -m venv env && source env/bin/activate

# Install dependences
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
$ python manage.py test

```

### Upload this package to Pypi

> **Warning**: before you update this package, certifies if you'll change the
> version in `setup.py` file.

If you interested contribute to developing this project, it was prepared a tiny tutorial to install the environment before you begin:

```bash
# Install venv in root project folder
$ python3 -m venv env && source env/bin/activate

# Update packages for development
$ python -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Generate distribuition -> it's on me for while ;)
$ python setup.py sdist

# Checks if the package has no errors
$ twine check dist/*

# Upload package -> it's on me for while ;)
$ twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

```

### Run local API test using this library

1. Run following command on terminal to up [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) docker container:

```bash
# in root project folder
$ docker-compose up
```

2. Open http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser
3. Create the following steps: 
   1. `realm`, `client` (as confidential) and your `client secret` according the [settings.py](/django-keycloak-auth/settings.py#L148) file
   2. Client Roles: `director`, `judge`, `employee` 
   3. Create a new user account
   4. Vinculate Client Roles into above user account


4. Run following command on another terminal:

```bash
# Install venv in root project folder
$ python3 -m venv env && source env/bin/activate

# Install dependences for this library
$ python -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Generate a local distribution for django-keyclaok-auth 
# Change the version of this library if necessary
$ python setup.py sdist

# Generate a local dist (verify version)
$ pip install dist/*

# Create migrations, fixtures and run django server
$ python manage.py makemigrations && \
  python manage.py migrate && \
  python manage.py loaddata banks.json && \
  python manage.py runserver
```

5. Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
6. Use [Insonmina](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test API's endpoints using Oauth2 as authentication mode.
